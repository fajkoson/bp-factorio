## Test Scenario

- smelting iron ore into steel (240/s per design)
- 256 smelters per test file
- 100x speed
- Benchmark: 5k tics, 5 sample runs per save file

### ðŸ§  **Analysis & Conculsions**

Comparing the builds that have the exact same base design, the lead follower pattern wins out. The iron larger design makes sense to be more performant as it has more beacons and consistent speeds across all furnaces, making it so the furnaces don't have to run as long
